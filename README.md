# Paranoid Mode

An opinionated guide to setting up and using PGP keys in a post-Snowden world.

I wrote for a `threat model` of either a nation state or close enough to one. As such is may need more hardware than you expect. 

### **What you will be able to do**

After completing this guide you will be able to:

 - receive and `decrypt` files and emails encrpyted with your `public key`,
 - `sign` files, text and other peoples public keys
 - `authenticate` yourself using PGP
