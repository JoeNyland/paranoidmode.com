# Paranoid Mode

An opinionated guide to setting up and using PGP keys in a post-Snowden world.

I wrote for a `threat model` of either a nation state or close enough to one. As such is may need more hardware than you expect. Don't let that deter you.

The hardware required can be purchased for less than $150USD. If you have an old computer lying around you can probably use that.

You should follow this guide if you are a **programmer**, **journalist**, **network administrator** or **sysadmin**, or someone who just uses `ssh` regularly.




### **What you will be able to do**

After completing this guide you will be able to:

 - receive and `decrypt` files and emails encrpyted with your `public key`,
 - `sign` files, text and other peoples public keys
 - `authenticate` yourself using PGP
