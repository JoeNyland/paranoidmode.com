# Subkeys

Your sub-keys, like your root key, are a normal key pair (a paired private key and public key). Unlike your root key, they cannot `certify` other keys. That capability is reserved exclusively for the root key.

Sub-keys are mostly ephemeral. You will replace them every year.

You should never have a copy of the private key of a sub-key
