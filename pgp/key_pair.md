# Key pair

Key pairs are a practical application of asymmetric encryption. 

## **Symmetric Encryption**

Alice has a wants to encrypt a file. She puts it in a box with a lock. The `key` to the lock is `secret`. She keeps a copy of this `key` to unlock the box later.

Alice now wants the file she encrypted. She unlocks (decrypts) the box with her `key`.

Pretty simple, one `key` both encrypts and decrypts our box. Or to put it another way both the lock and key are `secret`.

### Benefits and Threats

Symmetric encryption has it's benefits, but it also has threats that prevent it usage in all cases.

Symmetric encryption is fast, much faster than asymmetric encryption.

But, if the `key` is

I'd also strongly reccommend watching the entire [Khan Academy course on cryptography](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/cryptography).
