# Key pair

Key pairs are a practical application of asymmetric encryption. 

## **Symmetric Encryption**

Alice has a wants to encrypt a file. She puts it in a box with a lock. The `key` to the lock is `secret`. She keeps a copy of this `key` to unlock the box later.

Alice now wants the file she encrypted. She unlocks (decrypts) the box with her `key`.

Pretty simple, one `key` both encrypts and decrypts our box.

### Threats

Symmetric encryption has it's benifits, but it also has threats that prevent it usage in all cases.

I'd also strongly reccommend watching the entire [Khan Academy course on cryptography](https://www.khanacademy.org/computing/computer-science/cryptography).
