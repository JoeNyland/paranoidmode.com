## Symmetric encryption

Also known as **[symmetric-key algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric-key_algorithm)**, they are algorithms for cryptography that use the same cryptographic keys for both encryption of plaintext and decryption of ciphertext.

In comparison to asymmetric encryption, both parties require the same `shared key` in order to exchange encrypted messages.

## PGP


> Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) is a data encryption and decryption computer program that provides cryptographic privacy and authentication for data communication. PGP is often used for signing, encrypting, and decrypting texts, e-mails, files, directories, and whole disk partitions and to increase the security of e-mail communications. It was created by Phil Zimmermann in 1991.

## Key pair

Your PGP key pair consists of two parts: the `private key` and the `public key`.

It's vital that you never lose ultimate control of your `private key`. This means you need to take every (sometimes excessive) precaution to ensure your `private key` is not stolen, copied, or transmitted. If this happens, you need to revoke your `private key` and generate a new one as soon as possible.
