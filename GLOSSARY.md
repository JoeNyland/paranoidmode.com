## Symmetric encryption

Also known as [symmetric-key algorithms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetric-key_algorithm), they are algorithms for cryptography that use the same cryptographic keys for both encryption of plaintext and decryption of ciphertext.

In comparison to asymmetric encryption, both parties require the same `shared key` in order to exchange encrypted messages.
